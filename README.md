# Medical Store Management System

This project is an medical store management system. 

It handles basic inventory management including the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. It also performs pharmaceutical industry specific operations including removal of stock beyond expiry date and maintenance of batch numbers. In addition to inventory management, the system also handles billing. This provides a transaction record for each customer and enables the inventory to be updated after each transaction.
